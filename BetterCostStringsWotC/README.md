# Better Cost Strings

XCOM 2 mod that shows inventory counts and colour-codes entries in cost strings when building
items, starting research, etc.

## Compatibility

This mod can be activated for existing campaigns. It overrides the class "UIUtilities_Strategy",
so it is incompatible with other mods that override the same class.
